# Week Organizer CLI

A simple command-line tool to create weekly folders and files to organize study routines or projects. Built in C++ as a learning project.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Create a folder for a given week number (with leading zero): `week-01`, `week-02`, etc.
- Inside the folder, the following files are created (if they don't already exist):

## ðŸ“¦ Project Status

This project is in its early stage. The goal is to progressively enhance it while learning modern C++ and command-line interaction.

### âœ… Next steps

- [x] Basic CLI with command-line arguments
- [ ] Interactive CLI with user input (`cin`)
- [ ] File selection menu (e.g., `[âœ“] insights`, `[ ] study-plan`)
- [ ] Custom folder/file templates
- [ ] Optional overwrite protection

## ðŸ§ª Usage

Compile:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o organizer
```
Run:
```bash
./organizer -w <week_number>
```

This creates:
```
week-03/
â”œâ”€â”€ insights.md
â”œâ”€â”€ insights.pt-br.md
â”œâ”€â”€ references.md
â”œâ”€â”€ references.pt-br.md
â””â”€â”€ study-plan.md
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Practice with std::filesystem

- Handle command-line arguments (argc, argv)

- Work with file streams (std::ofstream)

- Use user input (std::cin)

- Implement basic CLI interface

## ðŸ“š Requirements
- C++17 or newer

- A C++ compiler like g++ or clang++
